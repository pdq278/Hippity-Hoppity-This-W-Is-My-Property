# Hippity-Hoppity-This-W-Is-My-Property
A GitHub repository for the course project in Introduction to Machine Learning (CPSC 4430) by Christopher Collins and Joshua Bales. The project is based on a machine learning approach to playing a game called Geometry Dash. It is a game wherein the objective is to jump at particular times while being moved forward to avoid spikes, walls, and other obstacles that result in the player dying. The goal of the project is to have the agent learn how to interact with this environment such that it is able to jump at the appropriate times and complete levels.
